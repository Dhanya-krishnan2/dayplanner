This is the program to create a daily planner by using html,css and jquery.
The aim of this program is able display the current day, date and month, so that i can plan my day.
In order to display my current date on the planner I used moment.js.
This planner is displayed with the business hours from 9am-5pm.
I declared and assigned value for my day planner array.
and used local storage to store the data.
Then i checked my planned day equal to my stored day.
The greatest advantage is I made rows, coloms, button which required for this planner created by using jquery, That makes it the html strucure simple.
