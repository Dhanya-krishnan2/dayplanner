This is the program to create a daily planner by using html,css and jquery.
The aim of this program is able display the current day, date and month, so that i can plan my day.
In order to display my current date on the planner I used moment.js.
This planner is displayed with the business hours from 9am-5pm.
I declared and assigned value for my day planner array.
and used local storage to store the data.
Then i checked my planned day equal to my stored day.
The greatest advantage is I made rows, coloms, button which required for this planner created by using jquery, That makes it the html strucure simple.
These are the screenshots of my dayplanner
In my planner it changes the color when the time is past to blue, and if it is a current it shows red color and future time block shows green color.
